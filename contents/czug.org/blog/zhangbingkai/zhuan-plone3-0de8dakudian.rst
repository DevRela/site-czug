<p><a href="http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/3.0">Plone 3 Release Candidate 1 is out</a>.
This is a big milestone in the evolution of Plone, and a big leap
forward for both developers and for everyday Plone users. The Plone 3
team is still putting the final polish on it, but Release Candidate 1
is more than ready for prodding, poking and testing. Here are eight of
the things about Plone 3 that I’m most excited to start using in
ONE/Northwest’s projects, with screenshots.</p>

<p> 1. A Big HTML editor update: Kupu 1.4</p>
<p>For a lot of everyday Plone users, Kupu (Plone’s graphical HTML editor) is
Plone. And in Plone 3, Kupu packs in a lot of improvements. All of the
changes in Kupu could fill up an article on its own, but the highlights
surely include:</p>
<ul><li>Named anchors</li><li>Automatic image resizing</li><li>Image captions</li><li>Inserting of Flash and other embeddable video (e.g. YouTube)</li><li>Span/character styles</li></ul>
<p>Together with all of Kupu’s existing goodness, most emphatically
including its ability to produce valid XHTML code, Plone 3 defines
“best of breed” for graphical HTML editing in a CMS.</p>
<p>Here are a few screenshots of Kupu in action, to whet your appetite.  Click on each image to see the full-size view.</p>

<p align="center">Captioned images — a frequently requested feature!</p>

<p><strong>2. Rich Text fields on Collections</strong></p>
<p>Ok, so this is a small feature. But it really makes me happy.
Collections (formerly known as Smart Folders, formerly known as
Topics), which are simple build-your-own query listings of content, now
have a Rich Text field, which means you can very easily write a nicely
formatted introduction to a dynamic listing of content. This is going
to make it really easy for non-technical site administrators to build
polished, lively sites without knowing a lick of code.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/collection1.png" alt="collection1.png" /></p>

<p><strong>3. The new “Sharing” tab</strong></p>
<p>Plone has long had a fantastic system for creating really precise
permissions on content. Plone 3 surfaces a lot of that power in a
simple way for everyday users. Check out the all-new “sharing” tab.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/sharing2.png" alt="sharing2.png" /></p>
<p>Nice! You can use this single, elegant screen to add give new users
&amp; groups the permission to view, to edit and to add new content in
a folder. That’s all you need to cover a pretty huge set of
intranet/extranet situations.</p>
<p>To see how radically this has improved in Plone 3, check out the old sharing tab from Plone 2.5:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/sharing1.png" alt="sharing1.png" /></p>
<p>Holy cow! That’s about 4x as large as in Plone 3, and it doesn’t
even do as much! Kudos to Alex Limi and Danny Blomendaal for the big
cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>4. New built-in workflows</strong></p>
<p>Plone 3’s elegant new sharing tab is more than complimented by
powerful new workflows. Once again, the Plone team has surfaced
powerful underlying systems in a friendly, accessible way. Plone 2.5
shipped with one standard workflow. Plone 3 ships wtih several simple
workflows, designed to support common user stories including simple
publication sites, community sites, and intranet/extranets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/workflows1.png" alt="workflows1.png" /></p>
<p align="center">Choosing among Plone 3’s new workflows.</p>
<p>You can associate these workflows with different content types, or
use the included CMFPlacefulWorkflow add-on Product to assign different
workflows to different folders. This makes it easy to build a single
Plone site that has a public-facing section and a rich, private
collaboration space.</p>

<p><strong>5. Link integrity: no more broken links</strong></p>
<p>Plone 3 has a powerful new “link integrity” feature that makes sure
you never break hyperlinks within your site as you move or delete
content. Here’s what happens when you try to delete an image that is
used in several pages.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/linkintegrity.png" alt="linkintegrity.png" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Versioning, staging and locking</strong></p>
<p>Plone 3 ships with big-league document management features, starting with <strong>document versioning</strong>.
Versioning allows you to save old versions of a page, compare your
current version to older versions, and even to roll back to previous
versions. Plone 3.0’s versioning is drawn from CMFEditions, the
well-established add-on Product, spiffed up with some nice new user
interface.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/history1.png" alt="history1.png" /></p>
<p align="center">Plone 3’s history tab showing all previous revisions of your document.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/history2.png" alt="history2.png" /></p>
<p align="center">Plone 3 can also show you exactly what’s been added
and removed between versions. Nerds call this a “diff” (short for
“difference”)!</p>
<p>Plone 3.0 is also scheduled to include document <strong>staging</strong>, the ability to work on a copy of a document while the old version is still live, via Kapil Thangavelu’s product “iterate.”</p>
<p>Finally, Plone 3.0 includes <strong>locking</strong>, which prevents
two people from making changes to a document at the same time.
Together, versioning, staging and locking will make Plone 3.0 very
appealing to folks who are managing sophisticated sites with multiple
people editing content at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>7. Automatic full-text searching of Word and PDF files</strong></p>
<p>Plone 3 automatically indexes the entire text of Word and PDF files
that you upload. (You can index other kinds of documents, too, with
simple add-on Products.) Again, this is a killer feature for intranets,
and for any other site that has a lot of document-centric content to
share with the world.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Thanks to Daniel Nouri for pointing out that this only
happens auto-magically if you have wvware (for Word) and pdftoext or
xpdf already installed on your system.</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/portlets1.png" alt="portlets1.png" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>8. User control of portlets</strong></p>
<p>Plone 3 has a entirely new “portlets” system. Portlets are those
little chunks of content that appear in the sidebars of a site. You
used to have to go into the ZMI backend to manage them. Now you just
click on “Manage Portlets,” then drag and drop your way to glory.</p>
<p>Plone 3 ships with one new kind of portlet, an RSS feed portlet.
There’s lots of room for add-on Product developers and site integrators
to develop interesting and innovative new portlets.</p>
<p>This feature alone is going to make a lot of our clients very, very happy.</p>
<p><strong>Summing Up
</strong></p>
<p>Plone 3 is the most ambitious, exciting release of Plone ever. It
pushes Plone to an incredible new level of power, and continues the
ongoing processes of polishing Plone’s legendary ease-of-use to a high
gloss.</p>
<p>Plone 3.0 RC1 is meant for testing, not production use. There are
still a few weeks of fast-paced bug-hunting ahead. That’s where you
come in. <a href="http://plone.org/products/plone/releases/3.0">Download</a> it.  Install it.  Play with it.  <a href="http://dev.plone.org/plone">Report</a> bugs.  Fix ‘em if you can.    Plone 3 should be released sometime in early/mid August.  I’m excited.</p>
