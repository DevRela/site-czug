<p>你该选Plone吗？转自Martin的对Plone的说明</p>
<blockquote>
As a general point, though - Plone is not a cheap solution, it's a
powerful and flexible one. Hosting Plone tends to require more juice
than a bare bones PHP CMS. Plone has a steeper learning curve, but can
be an incredibly productive platform. Plone aims at the &quot;upper end of
the mid market&quot;, and it definitely sounds like you're not at the lower
end. I would seriously consider an ITT, though, it's the only way you'll
get a good answer.  :)</blockquote>
<p>如果你是低端的用户，那些PHP CMS就可以了。Plone见长的是强大的功能和柔性，
开发效率高，缺点是学习曲线较陡，不易掌握。</p>
<p>Plone是面向中偏高端的市场的。如果要正式使用Plone，一般需要寻找专业服务商的帮助。</p>
