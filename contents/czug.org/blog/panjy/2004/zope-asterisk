 <p>Asterisk is a complete PBX in software. It runs on Linux and provides all
 of the features you would expect from a PBX and more. Asterisk does voice
 over IP in three protocols, and can interoperate with almost all
 standards-based telephony equipment using relatively inexpensive
 hardware.</p>
 <p>Asterisk provides Voicemail services with Directory, Call Conferencing,
 Interactive Voice Response, Call Queuing. It has support for three-way
 calling, caller ID services, ADSI, SIP and H.323 (as both client and
 gateway).</p>
