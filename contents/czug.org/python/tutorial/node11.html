<P>
Reading this tutorial has probably reinforced your interest in using
Python -- you should be eager to apply Python to solving your
real-world problems. Where should you go to learn more?

<P>
This tutorial is part of Python's documentation set.  
Some other documents in the set are:

 title="Python Library Reference"
 >Python Library Reference</a></em>:

<P>
You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though
terse) reference material about types, functions, and the modules in
the standard library.  The standard Python distribution includes a
<em>lot</em> of additional code.  There are modules to read <span class="Unix">Unix</span>
mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate random numbers, parse
command-line options, write CGI programs, compress data, and many other tasks.
Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of
what's available.

users.

explanation of Python's syntax and semantics.  It's heavy reading,

For Python-related questions and problem reports, you can post to the
newsgroup <a class="newsgroup" href="news:comp.lang.python">comp.lang.python</a>, or send them to the mailing
list at <span class="email">python-list@python.org</span>.  The newsgroup and mailing list
are gatewayed, so messages posted to one will automatically be
forwarded to the other.  There are around 120 postings a day (with peaks
up to several hundred),
asking (and answering) questions, suggesting new features, and
announcing new modules.  Before posting, be sure to check the list of
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.python.org/doc/faq/"
  >Frequently Asked Questions</a> (also called the FAQ), or look for it in the
<span class="file">Misc/</span> directory of the Python source distribution.  Mailing
list archives are available at <a class="url" href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/</a>.
The FAQ answers many of the questions that come up again and again,
and may already contain the solution for your problem.
